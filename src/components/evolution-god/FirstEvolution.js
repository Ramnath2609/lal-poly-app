        <b>Birth of the Universe - the first evolution of God.</b>

        <p>Scientific world is now focused on the search of God and the origin of life in the Universe. Scientific experiments are going on in the western world to find proof for the birth of Universe through a scientific assumption called Big Bang.</p>

        <p>The most popular theory of our universe's origin centers on a cosmic cataclysm unmatched in all of history—the big bang. This theory was born of the observation that other galaxies are moving away from our own at great speed, in all directions, as if they had all been propelled by an ancient explosive force.</p>

        <p>Before the big bang, scientists believe, the entire vastness of the observable universe, including all of its matter and radiation, was compressed into a hot, dense mass just a few millimeters across. This nearly incomprehensible state is theorized to have existed for just a fraction of the first second of time.</p>

        <p>Big bang proponents suggest that some 10 billion to 20 billion years ago, a massive blast allowed all the universe's known matter and energy—even space and time themselves—to spring from some ancient and unknown type of energy.</p>

        <p>The theory maintains that, in the instant—a trillion-trillionth of a second—after the big bang, the universe expanded with incomprehensible speed from its pebble-size origin to astronomical scope. Expansion has apparently continued, but much more slowly, over the ensuing billions of years.</p>

        <p>Scientists can't be sure exactly how the universe evolved after the big bang. Many believe that as time passed and matter cooled, more diverse kinds of atoms began to form, and they eventually condensed into the stars and galaxies of our present universe.</p>

        <p>The big bang theory leaves several major questions unanswered. One is the original cause of the big bang itself. Several answers have been proposed to address this fundamental question, but none has been proven—and even adequately testing them has proven to be a formidable challenge.</p>

        <p>If we take a deep look into the structure of the Universe and the atoms, we are amazed to find the hands of Intelligence and Love in the design and functioning of the universe.</p>

        <p>There are two worlds in the universe. They are seen world and unseen world. Quantum physics agree that there is only one unit of energy that transform into other forms of energy through a process. This single unit of energy is neither created nor can it be destroyed. There is existence of dark energy – 64% which we cannot see. One such example is Black Holes which is mega energy concentrated in a single point. The gravity is such that it shall draw stars bigger than Sun and consume it without leaving any trace. But we cannot see them as we see the planets and stars.</p>

        <p>Now the atoms. Atom is the smallest minute form of matter. The existence of atom defies human eye sight or the most advanced scientific telescope. The existence of atom is proved by the scientists through scientific theories. The existential proof of atom was demonstrated in the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the Second World War. Inside the atom there is space in which protons, electrons and neutrons revolve at huge speed. If the atoms are split, it releases immense energy. Two questions still defy any rational answer to the scientific world.. .who or what created the atom. How is it that minute particles, proton and neutron, found their way into atom? These atoms are the building blocks of the stars, planets and all inorganic matters in the world. Trillions and trillions of atoms form the planets and stars and mountains in the world. There seems to be the hand of an unseen skillful artisan at work behind this phenomenon.</p>

        <p>Now we shall take a look at the solar system. Sun holds all the nine planets and the satellites, say moon, in their fixed orbits through the massive gravitational force of the sun. Let us take a look from the angle of the planets. What holds the Sun as the center of the orbit of the planets? It is the combined force of the gravitation of the all planets. Moreover, each planet holds other planets in their fixed orbits through its gravitational pulls and pressure. Mercury not only holds the Sun at the center of the solar system, bur it has a definite role in keeping the Earth in its orbit and vice versa. In other words, it is all for each and each for all.</p>

        <p>We shall find the presence of the trinity of the Being in the solar system. First it is the unseen energy field that maintains the cosmic harmony. The divine intelligence designs and maintains the planets in their orbits. Above all, it is the Love that creates the condition for each for all and all for each. The life in Earth is possible only through the presence of this trinity of the Being in the evolution of the universe and the solar system.</p>
