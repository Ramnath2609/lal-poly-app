        <b>Evolution of life forms in the world – the second evolution of God.</b>

        <p>Religion – mythologies and organized religions – philosophy and science have been attempting to explain the origin of life in this world through their areas of investigation. True philosophy – Sophos – and religion relied on revelation of Truth to explain God and Creation; Science relied on empirical evidence through scientific investigation to find out the origin of life in the world. Let us start with religion and philosophy first.</p>

        <p>Genesis, the first of the five books called Pentateuch, starts with an account of creation of life forms..</p>

        <p>Creation of life forms began with vegetation, followed by sea based living organisms, say fish, then birds which was followed by wild animals. Finally man was created in the image of God. This is the process of evolution. . However, modern science agrees with this process of evolution in many areas except the beginning. </p>

        <p>There has been consensus of opinion among the scientists that the universe and life forms are the outcome of a process called evolution. The geologists studying the rocks and stones for traces of early life forms in the form of fossils or markings have come to a conclusion that early life forms originated in the sea. The Record of Rocks, the reference point of origin of life is estimated to be 1,600 millions of years old. The earliest of the rocks called Azoic rocks contain no traces of life. The first traces of life forms, say fishes, appeared in the Silurian division of Palaeozic Rocks division, about 500 million years ago. The organic evolution are traced from this point. </p>

        <p>What are these life forms consists of. What builds these life forms? Modern science has proved with authentic evidence that cells are the primary building blocks of all life forms. Now they talk of genes which contain DNA structure in helix form. Inside the DNA are found pairs of chromosomes. The mystery of the biodiversity of life forms is now resolved very convincingly. </p>

        <p>The difference in the number of pairs of chromosomes determines the different species. Like species beget the like due to this constant, say fixed number of chromosomes. Lions beget only lions and human beings only human beings. Inside the chromosomes, the scientists have discovered certain proteins that retain genetic memory. This memory spans seven generations. For example, when a child is born, its genes contain certain hereditary traits that include color of the skin, eyes, and even certain diseases. Besides, the intellectual faculty of the fore fathers and certain emotions are stored inside the genes. Four generations of fore fathers may be black complexioned but the child may be white. This is due to the genetic memory of the genes. The fifth generation of the forefather (great, great and great grant father) might be white complexioned. This is the unbroken chain of life.</p>

        <p>The roses may blossom and wither but the rosiness is eternal. Similarly, man may born and die. But human beings exist for ever. In other words, the individual is a link of the chain of life. When he dies, he leaves a part of him through his sons and daughters. He continues to exist.</p>

        <p>Is there any similar thinking in religious scriptures? In the Book of Genesis it is said; God reveals through history, nature, space and time. The omnipresence of the creator in the creations is stressed through these words. But in Baghavad Gita, Lord Krishna declares His Inness in the creations; I am the sky, water, wind fire and all the best elements of nature. Moreover, Arjuna I am in you.</p>

        <p>All matters are the assembly of atoms and each atom is a mini solar system. .Proton and neutron rotate round a nucleus inside the atom.   It should be borne in mind that atom belongs to the unseen world. The gene is a much more complex structure.</p>

        <p>The question is what created the atom and gene. Let us now hear what Einstein says of this. He declared openly that he did not believe in the God of the religion. Though a Jew, he had no faith in Yahweh. But confronted by the mysteries of the universe and cosmic harmony – the immense black energy, expansion of the Universe, the order and discipline of the solar system, the multitude of biodiversity -  he declared in the Solvay Conference of Nobel Laureates that there is a God and the God does not play dice.</p>

        <p>The Inness of the Being in the creation with such order and harmony reflects the unseen hand of the Divine Intelligence or Holy Spirit. The grant design of the universe is designed by the Divine Intelligence.</p>

        <p>The Becoming of the Being is the evolution of creation.. .</p>
