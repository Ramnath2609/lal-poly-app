        <b>Soliloquy of the Ingenio</b>
        <p>I crashed through the iron gates of life, bleeding from the torn fleshes and bruises. My heart is aching and a drowsy numbness is paining my senses as if I am drinking the poison of life. My persistent search to find answer to the fundamental problems of existence is still eluding me as I found myself like a child stranded in a festival ground divorced from its mother.</p>

        <p>What is God, what are the qualities and attributes of the God?</p>

        <p>Evolution of God is an attempt to find out what is Truth or God. Truth is not confined to the corridors of religion or philosophy alone. As the author of Genesis exclaims; “God is revealed in nature, history, space and time”</p>

        <p>Hence an integrated approach is required. It is time to synthesize religion, philosophy, science, and history to find out the Truth.</p>

        <p>Various attempts have been made by great enlightened minds all over the civilized world in the past to find out what Truth is; Dhamma in Taoism, Torah in Judaism, Logos in Greek philosophy and western philosophy, Prakirithi and Purush in Indian philosophy are such examples.</p>

        <p>Evolution of God encompasses everything under the sky to find out Truth.</p>

        <p>I do not know whether this approach is right or wrong. I do not claim that I have found out the Truth. This is only a search.</p>

        <p>Science and Technology has been progressing in leap and bounds. It even dares to challenge God and the Creation theory. Two such important discoveries are shaking the very foundation of religion from its foundations.</p>

        <p>One is the discovery of the so called God’s particle or Higgs Boson particle. The second one is Book if Life that catalogues the gene sequence of all living beings. Coordinator of the research team of Book of life, Dr. Warren Bret has openly challenged God that there is no need for God to create life as he himself shall be able to create life through genes.</p>

        <p>Scientists now proclaim that they have discovered the mystery behind creation in the Cern laboratory. Stephen Hawkins even went to the extent of declaring that the Universe has everything in it and that there is no need for God to create.</p>

        <p>This emerging trend in Science and Technology shall be the impending spiritual catastrophe looming large along the horizon of the human civilization. I have a fear that Science and Technology seems to vindicate the declaration of Frederick Nietzsche that God is dead. That God is dead if taken seriously will breed nihilism in man as he narrows down the distance to his grave yard in his old age.</p>

        <p>Is it true that the kingdom of mind or reason is ultimate and God is but a projection of mind, not a reality? -</p>

        <p>We seek Truth in fragments not in its totality. Knowledge is compartmentalized and dismembered in text books. We get a lot of information in educational institutions. Do we get a glance of Truth in the educational institutions? Then where shall we find Truth? Shall we wait with faith that Life will open its mouth and enlighten our hearts with Truth through our experience?</p>

        <p>Or shall we unite all the branches of knowledge into a single system of thought and search the Truth there?</p>

        <p>Am I qualified enough to claim that I have found God through the highway of the Kingdom of Reason. Shall Reason have a glimpse of a faint ray of God.</p>

        <p>God is an experience experienced in the stillness of mind which is the true prayer. Jesus claimed “I am in my Father and the Father is in me” Again He claims that “Nobody knows the Father except the Son.” He made this claim after His sojourn in the wilderness for forty days of stillness of the mind. After that He was enlightened and had the experience of the God in himself. Do I have that experience, Certainly not. Then how shall I dare to tread the path of wisdom where angels walk.</p>

        <b>1.	The Essence of God</b>
        <p>The Being or God constitutes the trinity of Cosmic Energy, Cosmic Intelligence and Love. This trinity is the essence of the Being or God. Creation is the process of the Becoming of the Being. In this process of Becoming, the Being is in the creation. In other words, the Being - or I shall call it the Creator- is not independent of the creation. The Being is not a person but an authentic Truth that is manifested in all forms of the creations – both inorganic and organic.</p>

        <p>In the Book of Genesis, Yahweh reveals itself to Moses in the Mount of Sinai in the following words. “I am THAT I am”.  What is THAT?  It is the ultimate Reality. </p>

        <p>The Hindu religion talks about MAYA which has two syllables; MA means not and YA means THAT. Anything that is not THAT is MAYA or illusion (Illusion is not the appropriate synonym for MAYA but I do not have any other word right now).</p>

        <p>If the mind concludes that the earth with all its bio diversity and systems created by human beings is the ultimate reality, independent of THAT or Being, then it is MAYA. On the other hand, if the Being is perceived in all the creations, the MAYA evaporates like a dew drop from the sunlight.</p>

        <p>In the book of Genesis, the presence of God in the creation is asserted in the following words; “God reveals in history, nature, time and space”. This statement shall be interpreted as that the creator is in the creations. Lord Krishna also reveals his omnipresence in the creations to Arjuna in the following words” I am the universe, fire, water, wind, the trees, the king, the subject, the life and even death” Krishna even goes to the extent of asserting that He is in Arjuna also.</p>

        <p>What then constitutes the essence of God? Quantum Physics asserts with certainty that there exists only one unit of energy in the Universe that is neither created nor can it be destroyed.</p>

        <p>This Inness of the Being in the organic and inorganic forms constitutes the mystery of Becoming.</p>

        <p>First, in the grand design of the inorganic forms in the Universe and then the organic evolution of life forms in this world.</p>

        <p>This evolution is manifested at two levels; first in the eternal conflict in man between his essence and essence. This conflict starts with the fall of Adam, the representative of man. In Adam, the mind came into being or Adam was conscious of his existence. He was the archetype of the Descartes model of existence. “ I think, therefore I exist”.  He is the first inventor of ethics, the good and bad and thereby he gets alienated from his essence. He was in total communion with God before his fall. In other words, he identified himself with his essence, the God in himself.</p>

        <p>The fall of Adam was the starting point of the evolution of civilization which includes religions, political systems, and economic systems. The eternal internal conflict between essence and existence is manifested through the Hegelian triad of thesis, anti thesis and synthesis. This process constitutes the evolution of God. Love and Intelligence fashion the Becoming into a cosmic unity based on cosmic justice. We shall find the evidence of this in the evolution of God in the following chapters.</p>

        <p>We shall find the presence of this trinity in the evolution.</p>
