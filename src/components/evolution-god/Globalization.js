            <h4>Globalization – the final battle of capitalism</h4>
            <p>Innoxus; Dear Master, will the globalization survive as the final stage of capitalism or will it collapse due to the inevitable emergence of an anti thesis, If so when will it happen?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; Dear Innoxus, you have asked an appropriate and relevant question in the context of the 21st century. To understand the emergence of capitalism as a global power, it is imperative that we need to travel through the pages of history two thousand years back. </p>
            <p>Certain historians point out that globalization had its genesis with the mission of Jesus, though Jesus never intended it. Jesus commanded his disciples to go farther and preach the Kingdom of God to Gentiles. His disciples faithfully carried out the mission of Jesus. But two important politico economic changes happened in Europe after Jesus. I wish to call them synthesis – emergence of new systems.</p>
            <p>The first system that replaced the inhuman system of slavery and the political domination of the Roman Empire was Feudalism which was the diluted form of slavery. Productive land and the means of production including capital was concentrated in the hands of a miniscule but powerful rich class called Lords who controlled the whole economy of the State from their manor houses. The other important actor who controlled vast estates was the Catholic Church. I am not going to discuss here in detail the Christian philosophy or the doctrines of Church that defended feudalism. We shall discuss it later. At the political front two powerful empires replaced the Roman Empire; Holy Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire. They controlled about30% of the world. America was not yet discovered; China, India and Russia remained outside the political influence of these two empires.</p>
            <p>The unholy alliance between religion and politics reached its peak during this era.</p>
            <p>Capitalism was in a more diluted form in feudalism than it was in the Roman Empire.  In the Christian Empire, Pope replaced the Caesar. The only difference was that Pope did not have a standing army. But he indirectly controlled the armies of the Christian kingdoms as the official head of the Holy Roman Empire. There was also a marginal change in the quality of labor.  The laborer was no more a slave but the laborer transformed into a bonded laborer under feudal system.</p>
            <p>The surplus value of labor was systematized and institutionalized in the feudal economic system with the sanction of the Church which also had an army of tenants in their vast estates.    Capital accumulated from the surplus value flowed into the coffers of the landlords who controlled the land, means of production and labor from their manor houses.</p>
            <p>Innoxus; Dear Master, bear with me for the interruption. Is it not Karl Marx who exposed the surplus labor in the colonial capitalistic system? Was it present in the feudal system? If so how?  How do you say that the bonded labor system enjoyed the sanction of the Church?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; Karl Marx never invented the theory of surplus value in capitalism. The greatness of Marx is that he exposed the surplus value of labor present in the capitalist system through brilliant analysis of the cost of production which includes wage, taxes of the govt, cost of raw materials and the profit generated by the bourgeois entrepreneur.  The profit is nothing but the surplus value of the laborer. Surplus value was present long before Marx in all forms of capitalistic societies. Even in the primitive societies, the women did all the household chores and even worked in the fields, tended the cattle as unpaid laborer. The husband, as the head of the family, enjoyed the surplus value of the labor of the wife. In the system of slavery, the slaves were treated as animals and they got food like animals. The only difference between the animal and slave was that the slave got meager clothes. That is all.</p>
            <p>In feudalism, the bonded laborer got wages that was barely sufficient for him to meet his basic needs. But he had to work for longer hours in the estates of the Lords. For example, if he worked for ten hours in the estate of the landlord, he got wage worth two hours of work. The monetary value of the eight hours of work was appropriated by the landlord.  This surplus value of labor was transformed into capital in the hands of the landlords.</p>
            <p>St. Augustine developed a sin theory during this period and it was recognized by the Pope. St. Augustine maintained that God allowed sin to exist along with virtue. But he has given the free will to the man either to chose virtue or sin. If a man suffered in poverty it was due to his sin but he could attain salvation if he changed his heart from sin.  This sin theory justified the economic injustice in the feudal system. The capitalistic forces always infiltrate into religion and politics to secure its position intact in any synthesis. This is why synthesis always ends up as another exploitative thesis.</p>
            <p>Now we shall see what happened after the collapse of feudalism in Europe. Industrial revolution emerged as the anti thesis to feudalism in Europe, resulting in the collapse of feudalism and emergence of colonialism as the new synthesis.</p>
            <p>Innoxus; Master, I have a doubt. I remember reading in the history books that it was Napoleon who brought about the collapse of feudalism. If it is so, is he not the anti thesis to feudalism?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; History books conceal the biases and prejudices of their authors. They are merely reports of events happened in a certain period. That is not history. Please remember that anti thesis is always not an event but a process that is impregnated in the thesis. At times, an individual emerges as an anti thesis and rebels against the thesis. For example; Jesus. He rebelled against the system of slavery and Roman Empire with his Kingdom of God as anti thesis. In the case of Jesus too, the grumbling discontent against Roman Empire and the system of slavery reached a flash point in Jesus. Any individual or system deserves to be called anti thesis if the individual or the system destroys the thesis and facilitates the emergence of a new system or synthesis.</p>
            <p>But in the case of feudalism, Napoleon simply challenged the divine ordained theory of kings. Only kings and his descendents were eligible to become rulers not the subjects. Napoleon destroyed that myth.</p>
            <p>Socialism emerged as a critique of capitalism. Marxism began essentially as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution.[129] According to Karl Marx, industrialization polarized society into the bourgeoisie (those who own the means of production, the factories and the land) and the much larger proletariat (the working class who actually perform the labor necessary to extract something valuable from the means of production). He saw the industrialization process as the logical dialectical progression of feudal economic modes, necessary for the full development of capitalism, which he saw as in itself a necessary precursor to the development of socialism and eventually communism.</p>
            <p>During and immediately after the Second World War, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other allied nations engaged in a series of negotiations to establish the rules for the postwar international economy. The result was the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank at the July 1944 Bretton Woods Conference and the signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at an international conference in Geneva in October 1947.</p>
            <p>This vision was articulated in the Atlantic Charter, issued by Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at the conclusion of the August 1941 Atlantic Conference. The Charter’s fourth point committed the United States and the United Kingdom “to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity,” while its fifth point expressed their commitment to “the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing, for all, improved labor standards, economic advancement and social security.</p>
            <p>After the Second World War, the world was polarized into two three camps; The whole of American Continent , about 35 countries, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and 16  Western European countries aligned with  United States and 9 East European countries aligned with  USSR. Nearly 45 third world countries (formerly the colonies of the European countries) formed a political block called Non aligned Movement, headed by Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Marshal   Josef Tito of Yugoslavia and Abdul Gamel Nasser of Egypt. About half of the world fell directly under the economic and political domination of United States led globalization. United States entered into military alliances with European, Asian and South American countries like, NATO, CENTO and SEATO to protect the economic interests of capitalism. This is the scenario after the Second World War. Historically this period was called the Cold War era.</p>
            <p>Innoxus; Master, what was the position of China in the cold war era.</p>
            <p>Ingenito; Thank you Innoxus for reminding me of the most important actor in this era. China fell into the hands of communists under the dynamic leadership of Chairman Mao Tse Tung. It was involved in a massive reconstruction of its economy through commune system.  An unfortunate incident happened in the communist world during the 1950s. Chairman Mao openly clashed with Josef Stalin of Russia regarding the socialistic model to be adopted by China. Mao refused to be a puppet state of Soviet Union and insisted on implanting socialistic system through the communes. He rejected the Soviet model of socialism and political structure. It was said that Stalin insulted Mao in the Second Communist International held in Moscow. China pulled down the Bamboo Curtain, isolated itself from the global politics and focused on strengthening its agriculture base and army. Napoleon once remarked” China is a sleeping giant. Do not wake her. If she is awake she will move the world”. His prophecy turned out to be true during the final assault of capitalism as a full fledged global force after the 1990s.</p>
            <p>Now let us see how globalization led by USA devised its evil design to bring the entire world under its influence. Though the number of countries directly under the political influence of Soviet Union was less, it resorted to the strategy of massive subsidized economic assistance and arms to the Non Aligned Movement countries to keep them away from the influence of United States.  Soviet Union supported these countries during any confrontation with United States in the United Nations. Globalization was able to spread its tentacles only half of the globe. The other half was able to resist successfully the globalization of their economies, thanks to the support extended by Soviet Union and other communist allies.</p>
            <p>Take the example of India. Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi adopted the mixed economy model. Heavy industries, energy, banking sector, public transport are under the control of the State. Only small and medium scale industries – mainly consumer oriented – are in the private sector.  But socialism is the political agenda of Congress Party. Though the World Bank and USA ignored India to support its reconstruction of the Indian economy, Soviet Union came forward to assist India in heavy industries.</p>
            <p>Besides, it provided oil and arms at subsidized prices. USA and its capitalistic western allies were enraged but felt helpless against the military might of the Soviet Union.</p>
            <p>But the Goddess of Fortune winked at USA and the globalization process. After the death of Chairman Mao, there emerged a strong man in China in the name of Deng Pshiao Peng. He is known for his widely quoted adage “it is not a sin to become rich”. USA quickly grabbed the chance and entered into close economic relationship with China which opened the windows for capitalism. Special Economic Zone was created in Shangai Province which allowed free flow of dollar and western capitalistic economic model. But China placed a lot of conditions to block the globalization drain the blood of China. The western countries are denied permission to purchase lands but only take the lands on lease, 40% of the profit should go to China and above all Chinese should be given priority in the jobs in the western companies.USA and the western allies agreed as their capital still reaped huge returns.</p>
            <p>The second wink of the Goddess of Fortune is the emergence of electronic mass media; say satellite based televisions and internet services. The glamour and glitter of the capitalist countries – not the poverty and unequal distribution of wealth – reached the nook and corner of the Soviet Union and its communist allies. The new breed of leadership emerged after the death of Leonid Brezhnev in Soviet Union.  Mikhail Gorbachev declared Glasnost and Perestroika which means transparency and reconstruction. What Gorbachev meant by Glasnost was American style freedom and democracy. Perestroika was capitalist economy. The soviet Russia dismantled its Central Asian and East European communist empire. </p>
            <p>The sweep of globalization was complete in the 1990s. The end of the second millennium marked the triumph of globalization throughout the world. Since 1990, America has been pushing ahead with the implementation of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff, - GATT – throughout the globe. Those countries that resisted the American imperialism – political and economic hegemony – either faced the ouster of the regime through military intervention or crippling sanctions. Ouster of Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Mommar Quaddafy of Libya are best examples of the brute force of Globalization. Iran, north Korea, Cuba and Venezuela are facing the wrath of America through sanctions. This is the warning signal sent to all the countries with a crisp message by America “either fall in line with globalization or get lost”</p>
            <p>Innoxus; Dear Master, please explain how America is using sanctions as a political tool to enforce globalization in third world countries? Why should not the third world countries say ‘mind your business’ to US sanctions?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; Three factors favor USA to force the rebellion countries to fall in line with its imperialistic designs of globalization through economic sanctions. First, the sheer strength of the US economy; the size of the US economy is about 25% of the world economy. Second factor is cross country investment. Multinational companies are investing in all continents. Moreover, the merger of big multinational companies is going on at faster pace. Third and the most important factor is dollar as the world currency. Let me illustrate this with an imagined example. Let us assume that India is under the sanction list of USA. Dear Innoxus, you have a motor bike. Can you name the company that manufactures this bike India?</p>
            <p>Innoxus; It is Kinetic Honda company.</p>
            <p>Ingenito; You are right. Kinetic company is a multinational corporation based in the Netherlands and Honda is based in Japan. It is a joint venture company in India. Kinetic is owned by Wasserman Group based in Germany. In kinetic Honda motor bike the economic interests of three countries are involved. Once sanction is imposed on India, the US will declare that no company or country should involve in any trade or business activity in India. Those company or country that defies the ban will be included in the sanction list. If Kinetic Honda Company continues its manufacture in India after the sanction, then US will impose sanctions on Kinetic Company based in Netherlands, Honda Company based in Japan and Wasserman Group based in Germany. These three companies have extensive investment and trade links with a lot of European and US based companies. Now all these countries will be forced to snap all business and trade links with these three companies. Soon these three companies will become bankrupt unless they close down their factory in India. Similarly all countries that have business and trade links with India will close their business activities in India.  The result will be disastrous for India. Ultimately India will collapse under the weight of sanctions. </p>
            <p>Innoxus; Dear Master, I am still confused. Why this sanction works and how dollar becomes the world currency?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; This is the ultimate peak of the growth of capitalism. Until the 19th century, gold was the world reserve currency. The currencies of the countries are backed by gold reserve. But America emerged a global economic power in the beginning of the 20th century. Then dollar replaced gold as global reserve currency. To understand this you must know the economic hegemony of US Capitalism. </p>
            <p>USA controls 30% of the oil in the American continent alone with 27 million barrels of oil per day. It also had control over 20% of Middle East oil with 20 million barrels of oil per day till 2000. Only Iraq, Iran and Libya with 8.5% of oil with about 8.5 million barrels of oil per day defied US domination. In the 21st century, US has killed Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Quaddafy of Libya and has taken control of 4.5% of oil or 4 million barrels a day. Iran is still holding its ground under heavy sanctions. The moment Iran opens the doors of its oil refineries to USA, and then Iran will be the darling of America. This is one example. US economy controls 25% of the global economy. This 25% includes the US strangle hold on the whole American Continent. Hence dollar is accepted as the world currency. Besides, US controls World Bank and International Monetary Fund as it is the biggest share holder of these two global financial institutions. In 2013, 124 countries borrowed 6 trillions of dollars from the World Bank. Not less than 2 trillion dollars they received from International monetary Fund.</p>
            <p>Dear Innoxus, you will be dumb founded by the interest these financial institutions extract from these countries, particularly third world countries. Let us imagine a situation. India borrows 100 billion dollars from the World Bank to develop agriculture and oil exploration. When it sanctions the loan, World Bank will advise India to purchase the machineries from US companies. The loan of 100 billion will go to the US based companies. .After a certain date World Bank will knock the doors and demands 800 million dollars interest. If India does not have the money, It will recommend International Monetary Fund to provide a loan of 800 million dollars to India to repay the interest to the World Bank. Next year, World Bank will again knock the doors for interest. IMF comes behind and demands the interest for 800 million dollars. This is how the countries fall into the debt trap of capitalism. Once India is not able to repay interest or loan, USA will force India to sell the public limited companies to US based multinational corporations.  Moreover, it will force India to cut the subsidies for agriculture, gas and even cut down public welfare measures like free medicine, free education etc. As a result, the poor becomes poorer and the rich richer. This is how capital is accumulated in the hands of capitalistic countries. </p>
            <p>Dollar is the most powerful political weapon in the hands of America.</p>
            <p>Innoxus; Is there not a way out for us?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; The prophecy of Karl Marx will become a reality soon. He observed that when capitalism reaches its peak, it will collapse under its own internal contradictions. The rumblings of the impending collapse have already been heard. Take the example of Greece, a capitalist country in the European Economic Union. Greece borrowed heavily from World Bank, IMF AND European Community. It was not able to repay the interest or debt. The World Bank, USA and the European Banks advised Greece to launch austerity measures. That means cut down subsidies for agriculture and public welfare measures to repay the debt. It even went to the extent of slashing old age pension. Civil unrest erupted in Greece Alarmed, European Community led by Germany pumped a massive credit of 800 billion fresh loan to Greece to save its economy from Bankruptcy and civil war. They feared that the collapse of Greece will trigger a series of collapse of many small capitalist countries in Europe, say Portugal, Ireland, Italy etc. which are already reeling under the debt. </p>
            <p>Innoxus; Master, how does this internal contradiction works?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; At its peak, capitalism starts destroying its own market, like an octopus eating its own hands to save from hunger. Capitalism will dig its own grave. Take an example of shopping malls. One shopping mall employs 500 workers in India and pays a monthly salary of Rs. 3,000/ per worker. These workers will not be able to purchase any articles from the shopping mall as the costs are prohibitive. Only the rich can afford to purchase articles from the malls. Suppose there are 1000 shopping malls all over India. That means these malls loose 5, 00,000 customers. The same thing happens in auto mobile industry and so on.  Hence they depend on the rich class only for selling their products. But a point of saturation will reach for the rich class who are always a minority. Now the malls that face loss close down the business resulting in unemployment. If 500 malls are closed, 2, 50,000 persons lose their jobs. This happens in all industries. Now the govt. is forced to increase spending on social welfare measures like free clothing, free food provisions, free medical service to contain rebellion from these unemployed persons. The taxes from the rich class are not enough to meet the govt. expenditure. Hence they borrow from rich capitalistic countries. They will force the country to slash public welfare spending. This vicious cycle intensifies the inner contradiction. On the one hand, the number of billionaires will increase, say Amabanis, on the other hand, the number of poor will also increase. This will facilitate the clash between thesis and anti thesis. The demand for socialism or communism will gather momentum, resulting in the collapse of capitalism.</p>
            <p>Innoxus; Dear Master, what is the position of United States, the patron of capitalism. Is it safe?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; America has reached the flash point. The total debt of USA is 17.8 trillion dollars. The combined gross domestic product or the size of the economies of the five large economies in the world - Germany, Britain, France, Japan and Italy – is 15.7 trillion dollars. The total strength of US economy is 14 trillion dollars. The US debt is much higher than this.  It is surviving on the strength of dollar as the global currency. An American author has written a book with a title” Rogue Nation”. In the book he analyzed 100 wars launched by USA since the Second World War to protect its economy from collapse. The Iraq and Libyan wars belong to this category. America is making a last ditch battle to avoid collapse from its internal contradiction and hence it is launching war in the oil rich regions to take control of the oil industry in the Middle East. </p>
            <p>Innoxus; Master, what is our fate? Will India be also swallowed by globalization sweep?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; Integration of India into the globalization process started in the Congress regime of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. It got accelerated during the period of Manmohan Singh.  Now Mr. Narendra modi has sealed the fate of India. He has already declared privatization of railways and insurance. Disinvestment of shares of the core industries has been going on. Already agrarian sector is suffocating under the slashing of subsidy. Cooking gas and kerosene follows next.  Within the next five years, water and energy will be totally privatized.  Multinational companies will fix the price of drinking water. Your right to livelihood will be dictated by Western Capitalists.</p>
            <p>The world will see the cruel face of globalization after the year 2020 when the Intellectual Property Right will come into force through GATT. The growth of capital will take a new dimension.  Under this Act, the price of any commodity produced anywhere in the world will be determined by the company or country that has Patent Right. I will illustrate this with an example; Paracetamol tablets are now produced in India. It is an effective pain killer and reduces fever. It is freely available in govt. hospitals and Primary Health Centers through health subsidy scheme of the govt.  Even if you purchase it in medical shop the cost is less than one rupee per tablet. Assume that a multinational drug company in USA has the patent right for Paracetamol. After 2020, it will declare the global price for this tablet. Assume that the company has fixed a price of Rs.30/ per tablet. All the western drug companies will follow similar policy. What will happen? India will be forced to raise its health subsidy by 30% to enable the poor get these drugs at the current price or free of cost in govt. hospitals. But the World Bank and USA will not accept this massive health subsidy as this move will affect India’s capacity to repay the debt with interest to western capital. Already India’s debt is around 480 billion US dollars. By 2020 it will cross one trillion mark. India will face the dilemma of Greece. The internal contradiction will create a civil war like situation. If the govt. uses brute force like armed forces to quell the civil disturbances, it will strengthen the Naxal forces or a new breed of terrorism. This will happen all over the world.</p>
            <p>This will eventually emerge as the anti thesis to the thesis – the globalization.</p>
            <p>Innoxus; Master, what will be the result of the clash between the globalized capitalism and the anti globalization forces, say thesis and anti thesis.</p>
            <p>Ingenito; The result will be disastrous. US led global economic imperialism called globalization will collapse by 2050. It will face the fate of earlier thesis, say, system of slavery and Roman Empire, Feudalism and the Christian Empire, and Colonialism.  That is the prophecy of many well informed political and economic pundits. It may ignite a third world war. Who knows? </p>
            <p>Innoxus; Master, is there not a peaceful way out?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; There is a well known adage; where there is a will, there is a way. To find out the way, we need a dream. This is a dream. We need to dream a brave new world where no direct elections to the National Parliaments take place; no direct elections to State Assemblies; not even to Panchayats.</p>
            <p>Dream instead of a world where parliaments come to the streets. The whole world gets organized into neighborhood parliaments of about 30 neighboring families. Each neighborhood families become a kind of mini world or mini nation.</p>
            <p>These families are sensitized and inculcated the ethics of enough and love which will be the unwritten constitution of the neighborhood families. Love of the neighbor bonds them together voluntarily without any external compulsion. Each neighborhood parliament has a neighborhood cabinet, with a neighborhood chief minister and ministers for various concerns like health, hygiene, environment, income generation, children’s education etc.   All the families are thus organized and federated under village parliament which will also have a cabinet like the neighborhood parliaments. Next tier is the federation of all village parliaments under Panchayat level Parliaments. The pyramid goes to the top through state level, national level and world parliament.</p>
            <p>Once this dream materializes, the pro capitalistic democracy will vanish and new political culture called sociocracy will emerge. This sociocracy will be based on the following five principles</p>
            <h4>Principle One; principle of numerical uniformity</h4>
            <p> The numerical uniformity is maintained at all levels,  from Panchayat to world parliaments. Each higher level is represented by the lower level. This numerical uniformity will replace the bigness of the present democratic parliamentary system which maintains its numerical superiority through manipulation.</p>
            <h4>Principle Two; small is beautiful</h4>
            <p>Small is always beautiful. A small forum provides opportunities for participation in decision making and governance</p>
            <h4>Principle Three; Principle of recall</h4>
            <p>We need not wait for five years to call back an elected representative through elections. If we are not satisfied with a representative, we shall convene the parliament and recall the person and send somebody else to articulate the concerns of the people.</p>
            <h4>Principle Four; Principle of Subsidiary</h4>
            <p>Subsidiary units get the focus here. Vitality, dynamism and power are concentrated more at lowest levels possible. Higher levels never take up the issues and concerns handled by lower levels of this governance structure. Higher levels deal only with those issues that are beyond the capacity of lower levels. For example river water issue. </p>
            <h4>Principle Five; Principle of Convergence</h4>
            <p>This means that once you have such a network everything convergences at this network. Everything is done through it. This reinforces the structure further and further.</p>
            <p>Innoxus; Master, this seems to be a utopian dream. Is it possible to realize this dream?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; Everything is possible if there is a political will among the people. Let me cite one example from our neighbor. In Kerala, they have Kudumbastree forums which are similar to our Self Help Groups. Later they formed Vanitha Ayalkootum which is a grass root neighborhood parliament. Soon it gathered momentum and spread to many districts. The base units were soon federated under village level Ayalkootums and then Panchayat level Ayalkootums. The political parties were alarmed at the emergence of the women political force. The govt. then resorted to a dirty political blackmail and stopped the movement at Panchayat level only. In the recent Panchayat elections, women have won more than 50% of the Panchayat President seats. This is the display of sheer political will of the neighborhood based women. Tomorrow these women shall contest in Assembly elections and assert the gender power. Who knows? </p>
            <p>Innoxus; Dear Master, Will the capitalistic forces now deeply entrenched in the present day political structure allow this to happen? Will they not use force to nudge this dream in the bud?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; Of course, yes. The only viable and practical strategy is to wrest control of the market from the hands of capitalism. Dear Innoxus, do you know what constitutes the real strength of capitalism?</p>
            <p>Innoxus; The control of global market</p>
            <p>Ingenito; Yes, you are right. The strength of capitalism lies in their monopoly over the global market. What is market? Market is the people not a place. Capitalism has brainwashed our minds to assume that market is a place. Never. </p>
            <p>Each neighborhood parliament will have a minister for market.  Thus all the higher level parliaments have their own ministers for market. The base unit – the neighborhood parliament will discuss the place orders for their products, say provisions, clothes and what not, to the village level which collects the orders and place them to the Panchayat level Parliament. Finally, the district level Parliament gathers orders for the commodities throughout the district from the lower levels. The minister for market at the district level procures the commodities from the producers. For example, the rice, spices, pulses and cereals will be procured directly from Farmer Producer Groups from the neighboring district or states. The immediate result is that the middlemen are eliminated from the market and producer – consumer link is established. The products made by Self Help Groups will be preferred to the products of mullti national companies .In each Panchayat there will be producer groups of those commodities for which it has a comparative advantage.</p>
            <p>When this model is replicated at global level the big business houses will either vanish or fall in line with the grass root parliaments.</p>
            <p>Innoxus; Dear Master, what will be the economy of this new system?</p>
            <p>Ingenito; There will be no capital and accumulation wealth in a few hands. Land will be the common property and all the means of production are owned by the people collectively. The scientific invention will be the property of the community or the parliament. Those scientific inventions that contribute to the well being of the community will be approved by the parliament through consent. The concept development will be redefined with a new emphasis. Development will not be at the cost of ecology. The present paradigm of development is economy oriented. The new shift will be towards ecology and environment in harmony with the Declaration of Human Rights in the United Nations Charter; mankind has an obligation to maintain the environment as it is now for the future generation. All pollutions caused by the not enough ethics of capitalism will vanish in the thin air.</p>
