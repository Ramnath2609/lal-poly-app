        <b>Kodikkal, Thoppil Basi and Vayalar Rama Varma</b>

        <p>Kodikkal is an excellent story teller. He narrates beautiful stories he had heard or listened to in the past or create stories from nowhere just like a spider weaves a web from its belly. He is such a man of rich imagination.</p>

        <p>I used to kid him quite often to recall the past and narrate wonderful anecdotes or incidents that happened in his life.</p>

        <p>It is a pleasant experience to share the nostalgic memories of Kodikkal during the period of his youth. He will carry you on the psychological time machine and recreate certain incidents that will cradle your heart like a breeze cradling the flowers. His body language, tone of his voice and facial expressions will enchant everybody who encounters him.</p>

        <p>The following narrations are such interesting incidents that happened in his life.</p>

        <p>When I asked him to recall any interesting incidents with important personalities in his life, a flash of smile and energy enveloped his face.</p>

        <p>“Yes! I remember one incident. I was the Nagercoil Town Communist Party member in 1972, I think so. Then I entertained a desire to meet Thoppil Basi and get his permission to stage certain outstanding pro leftist dramas. Then Thoppil Basi was a key person in the Kerala Peoples’ Arts Club located in Kayankulam.</p>

        <p>It was located in  about 2 to 3 acres of luscious plantation with all infra structure facilities to stage dramas.  It was the time “ ningal enne communist aaki” ( you made me a communist) drama had been making waves all over Kerala.</p>

        <p>I entered the reception and found a simple man with lungi and banyan smoking beedi. In front of him was an aluminium tumbler that contained a bundle of beedies. Another small cup served as an ash container.</p>

        <p>I stood before him, thinking that he might be an office assistant. He stared at me and enquired “ “enthaa?” meaning ‘what?’</p>

        <p>I told him that I wanted to see Thoppil Basi. He flashed a smile and replied “ I am Thoppil Basi”</p>

        <p>“Daniel! I was shocked at the reply. I imagined a figure which was totally different from the reality. Such a simple man but an outstanding writer in Kerala. When he came to know that I was a communist leader from Nagercoil, he stood up, hugged me and talked with me as if I was his intimate friend.</p>

        <p>Then he received a phone call and asked the person in the other end “ Thirumeni, eppol varum” The word “ Thirumeni” startled me. I asked him who that person was. Thoppil Basi laughed aloud and said “have you seen Chemmeen movie?” I said yes. “ Can you recall the lyricist of the movie?”</p>

        <p>I said “Vayalar Rama Varma”</p>

        <p>“You are right! He is on the way. We are heading towards Trivandrum. You also accompany us.”</p>

        <p>My joy knew no limits as he was also my favourite poet. I was a bit surprised to know that a person from the royal family was a man with leftist ideas. ‘ Thirumeni” is a prefix used by persons from Travancore Royal families.</p>

        <p>Then I was accompanying them from Kayankulam to Nagercoil in a car. Two important personalities from Kerala had been with me in the car. Oh! No! No!. Rather I was with them. That might be correct.” He paused with a sense of humility.  I was in the back seat.</p>

        <p>Now Vayalar narrated a beautiful incident while driving the car. Whether it was a real incident or the outline for a new story he proposed to write, I did not know.”</p>


        <b>This was the story.</b>

        <p>Omana was married happily to Vasudevan who was working as a typist in the Kerala State Rubber Board.  Though it was not a love marriage, both Omana and Vasudevan lived together as lovers. The climax of their lovely marital life was a beautiful child aged two years.</p>

        <p>Vasudevan and Omana experienced nothing but joy and contentment in their lives.  But occasionally she fell into a state of depression when her husband was away from home for office work. She never dared to share it with her husband.</p>

        <p>One day Vasudevan returned back from duty rather early. It was an unusual incident. Omana did not expect his return back to home so early.</p>

        <p>Vasudevan suffered a headache in the morning and hence he applied for leave and was about to enter his home. Whether it was a hallucination or a reality, he was not able to confirm. He seemed to see a youth scaling the backyard wall and was jumping outside the wall of his house.</p>

        <p>When he knocked the door, Omana opened the door with a surprise over his unusual return back to home. He simply said of his head ache and was shocked to find half cup of hot tea on the small stool in the parlour. He never asked for explanation from Omana for the half undrunk tea.</p>

        <p>He knew very well that his wife would not drink tea at odd hours except in the morning and in the evening. He experienced severe head ache and asked for a strong cup of tea. As he was sipping the tea, both Omana and Vasudevan maintained a studied silence.</p>

        <p>Since that day, the intimacy between Vasudevan and Omana started to widen gradually. The suspicion in the mind of Vasudevan was initially fuming with smoke but Omana did not make any efforts to give explanation for the half drunk hot tea on that fateful day. Vasudevan also refrained from asking any explanation.</p>

        <p>Their sweet darling, the little child temporarily held the mother and father together. But the suspicion engulfed the entire inner being of Vasudevan that he could no longer hold his peace. He stopped having the normal sexual intercourse with her for long. Still Omana maintained her silence over the issue.</p>

        <p>“At this point, Thoppil Basi, asked Vayalar to stop the car by the road side and continue the story. He was scared that Vayalar was deeply involved in the story narration and hence he was afraid of any untoward accident.</p>

        <p>But Vayalar laughed away the fears of Thoppil Basi and assured him of his control over the car and continued the story”</p>

        <p>Finally, Vasudevan decided to divorce his wife and Omana offered no objection to his bitter decision.</p>

        <p>Time started moving slowly but steadily. Omana married another person but Vasudevan remained a bachelor as became a misogynist. Twenty years later their first daughter was twenty two years of age and Omana arranged a marriage for her.</p>

        <p>She sent marriage invitation to everybody. After a long mental trauma and agony she decided to send the marriage invitation to Vasudevan also.</p>

        <p>Yes she did sent.</p>

        <p>On the occasion of the marriage, Vasudevan visited the reception, blessed the newly married couple. He did not had the meal just stared at Omana and left the reception hall.</p>

        <p>“By the time the story reached this stage, Trivandrum arrived and It was time that I should get down at Thambanoor Bus Stand. But I could not resist my temptation to know about the person who scaled the wall 20 years ago from the house of Omana.</p>

        <p>As I got down, I asked hesitatingly to Vayalar in Malayalam. “athu aara, chuvar ethi chaadi oodiyathu?”( Who was that person who jumped over the backyard wall?)</p>

        <p>Vayalar could not control his laughter and said” He was the brother of Omana. He was convicted for a murder case and the court sentenced him seven year imprisonment. The family members of Omana warned her strictly that she should not reveal this to Vasudevan who hailed from Vayanad and hence he had no chance of knowing of this incident.</p>

        <p>Twenty years ago, on that fateful day, he was on parole and he wanted to see his sister as he could not attend her marriage. But she did not agree with his desire to see her as she was scared of the consequences in case her husband came to know of it. What she feared happened finally”</p>

        <p>Then both  said good bye and left”</p>

        <p>Kodikkal finished the story and flashed a smile at me which is his trade mark even today. I asked him whether Thoppil Basi had written any short story on this story line. Kodikkal paused for a moment and struggled hard against his continually failing memories to recapture the answer. But he failed and said that he did not know.</p>

        <p>He then asked me why I asked the question. I felt embarrassed but mustered enough courage and replied that I had the idea of writing a short story on this in English and publish in some magazine in English speaking countries. He appreciated my enthusiasm but warned me not to do so as it would be a theft of copy right.</p>

        <p>I am still making enquiries to persons who have read the stories of Thoppil Basi about this story.</p>
